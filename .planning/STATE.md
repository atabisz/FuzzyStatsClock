## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: Phrase engine built first (no WPF dependency); validates core logic before UI exists
- [Roadmap]: Window shell built second (isolates three-way transparency constraint from logic)
- [Roadmap]: Integration is Phase 3 (font/size/legibility decisions need actual phrase text on transparent background)
- [Roadmap]: DISP-04 (timer/update cadence) placed in Phase 3 — requires both engine and window to exist

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Phase 3]: `SizeToContent="WidthAndHeight"` behavior with long phrases (e.g., "just a little after twenty-five past") should be verified early — window auto-sizing may clip or produce awkward dimensions at the chosen font size.
